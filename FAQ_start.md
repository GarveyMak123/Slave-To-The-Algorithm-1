Then, you show your image on your "README" page by using general html markup, eg `<img src="yourImage.jpg" width="350" />` or you can use the Github MarkDown version which should be written like this: `![](archiSTORM_01_1.png?raw=true)` shows...

## How do I make my repo visible as a website?

You will need to have either readme.md or index.html files in each directory you want to be viewable. You will need to activate Github Pages to set your Repo/Project/Branch as a web directory (got to settings). If no index.html files are found in the folder, the readme.md will be used as a base page and will be styled with Github's own markdown (a type of CSS/styling).
