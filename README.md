# Slave-To-The-Algorithm
Studio-related & useful code
This Repository is for students and studio colleagues to find, store and share code for Slave To The Algorithm.

Look in each week's /code folder for snippets from the weekly workshops. Each week's 'readme' will have links to artists. Each week will be listed here as it gets activated.

## [First Things First](FAQ_start.md)

Please set up your own github repository to store your sketches/code and software. Each week you will make a new folder with (at least) a README.md with one or more screenshots of the work you have done in class and your other experiments. You will also upload your code from your inclass & extended activities in these folders. 

You will tell me your github address in class and you will add it to [this document](student_githubs.md) by making your very first pull request.
