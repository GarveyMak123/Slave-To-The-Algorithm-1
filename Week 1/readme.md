# Slave To The Algorithm : Week 1

### We made it! (sorta.. :)
This week's class was split between a wide-reaching 'overview' of the field of generative and parametric design, these specifics on the seminar, and the link to the seminar slides can also be found [almost verbatim] on Canvas.
## Week 1: Introduction to Parametric and Generative design
**Slave to the Algorithm: Seminar Week 1**

This week we started looking at what parametric and generative design means, and crudely speaking we could find that it all boils down to setting rules by which design is made— 'parametric design' is dependent on variables that alter the geometry or other factors (like a template), while 'generative design' creates new objects or visuals where there were not any before (as if you are growing something). We spoke about a (non-computational) parametric system we may have used in our home today (Sylvain made smoothies :)

As far as `Why should we care?` or rather why are we here in this studio, we started with http://thispersondoesnotexist.com which is a prime example of a generative  system, and begs the question `What can't algorithms do?`.The outcomes of parametric & generative design processes can take any and every form you are already familiar with in design + plenty of others that may be new to you, for example you can design (parametrically and generatively) objects, visuals- both static and animated, type, stories, books, packaging, UX, UI, experiences, drawing machines, web design, textiles, apparel and even film, music, literature & photography. We discussed why a designer should be aware of these processes, and in the near future, while you may not directly take full responsibility (ie. make/code/set up) for these systems, knowing how they work and what aspects can be potentially controlled or 'designed' will become essential as more automation is adopted in your discipline. By the end of this course you should be able to comfortably converse in, observe, and critique these systems. This will assure that you and your future clients are making the most of the technologies available.

We started with an overview of some work I have made with Andy Simionato (hint: we almost always work together) in generative and parametric art & design—for example, some bespoke multi-lens `tweeting` selfie cameras, various drawing machines, Artificial Intelligence-driven publishing, and other past internet and new media works. Then we looked at some work by some inspiring artists, designers, including some recent graduates of RCA, RISD, & Parsons' visual communication programs, and even recent graduates of RMIT, with exemplars of typefaces, 3D printing, publications, installations and animated visuals.

**Activity 1: Roll the Dice!**
We broke into groups to do some 'parametric drawing'. You were tasked with setting up rules by which you drew to a an artboard or piece of paper (url or irl) and we looked at the differences of rules and the differences of outcomes. We saw the first hints of `algorithmic bias` creeping in to our assumptions :)

**Activity 2: Get on Git!**
As your SKO for this semester will be delivered as a Github Repository, our next task was to get everyone an account and establish a 'repo' for the course, with a 'readme.md' in the main directory and a week1 folder.  Instructions on how to do this are linked through from the readme on the Slave To The Algorithm 2020 Repo. Then, we collectively edited the file ../student_githubs.md and I processed in real time your edits (or "pull requests") as Github refers to them. You can see a recording on how to merge requests [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_PzC6nqs1x8XRx8axmFNbs0G_5BmVThA?usp=sharing). We saw how the Github system allows you to create a web page from your account, so you could integrate this system to show your work in progress and/or your final project in a browser [more on this as we move forward].
