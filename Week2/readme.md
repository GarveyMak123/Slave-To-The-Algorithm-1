# Slave to The Algorithm: Week 2
## Recap & resources

We made it through our first coding workshop in one piece! And we all created a Portrait in code that we showcased and remixed (who'd ever have thought that was possible in one week?) 

## Seminar Links:

Slides from the Instructional art & First steps in Processing (here)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LylnGfGHJzNPmjcpAnCd-lasB5qAuJS9/view?usp=sharing]  Also the workshop part of the class was recorded in (Canvas/Collaborate Ultra)[https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/76067/external_tools/546] (look under 'Recordings')

## Your "GITHUB", otherwise known as your SKO (assessable): 
Please start populating your Githubs with the material we covered in class. You can organise this as you like, but you may find it useful to make a new 'folder' / directory for each week into which you can add the images/sketch folders etc and the summary of the week's research/process can be in that folder's readme.md.
You should be posting extended research into the field + documentation of in-class work + reflective documentation on own practice (this makes more sense when we start working on our assignments) and of course your code.

## PROCESSING: 
We have made a cracking start to learning Processing, and with a small push next week you will be able to confidently create your own simple design works. By the end of next week's (shorter) class you should be able to manipulate shapes, pictures and text with code. We will not work so intensely on Processing every week, but I do want every one of you to be comfortable with the basic drawing functions. I just wanted to thank you all for bringing such a positive attitude to what can be a daunting first step :) See the class github (Links to an external site.) for more code examples and 'cheatsheets'.
### PROCESSING- HOMEWORK: Before next week's class, 
* 1) please remix someone's code from the (group portraits)[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v8lqNxFf1I9KQwnq0WP4O4X91jkJRPxp6sYsOyW4EDI/edit?ts=5f238e39#] and 
* 2) look at the Processing examples in the in-built 'examples' folder (available under file/examples), &/or online at Open processing https://openprocessing.org &/or in the (Processing Gallery)[https://processing.org/exhibition/] or anywhere else in the webiverse where Processing sketches may live and be shared.

* PLEASE CHOOSE AT LEAST ONE sketch to share in class as a case studyâ€”be ready to demonstrate to the class the sketch you found, and explain why you found it interesting. You do not have to understand how it works, but great if you do :)

* 12 -HOUR CHALLENGE:  If you did not complete this in Week 2, feel free to do it this week and add your outcomes to (12-HOUR CHALLENGE slides)[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fq59Ty1EVfqPnzBiMFSJ-o15gUr5H8e-BN9Gb1COebc/edit] and for some 12-hour challenge in action, you can see Hun Lee 'generating' dinner...

MATERIALS for WEEK 3 Class:
Please, in addition to your laptops etc, please bring along some crafty stuff, such as a ball of string, some pencils/markers, some elastic bands, some push pins and a cardboard box or some board/card.
WORKING SETUP: We will go 'analogue' for a bit in class, so you may even want to find ways to keep contact with the class that is not tethered to your laptop.  Remember that Canvas can run as an app on iOS & Android, (ipads and other mobile devices),  so you can probably also run collaborate ultra  through the app, alternatively you may be able to send your collaborate ultra window to another screen (a tv or projector?), this may help you engage in a more 'free' way and use your space/bodies differently.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask,

Looking forward to seeing you on Friday,

karen ann
